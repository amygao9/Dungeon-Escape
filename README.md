# Dungeon-Escape
Dungeon Escape is an android app 
Our game consists of 3 levels that are completed in succession in order to escape the dungeon. 

*Note: The project was completed in two phases. The phase 2 folder holds the final product that we have made, while phase 1 was a rough draft.

## Usage
This game should be run on a Pixel 3 API 28.

## Features
Note that if you exit a level in the middle,
(without completing it) your progress from that level will not be saved and it will return to the
level you were last on the next time the game is loaded.
